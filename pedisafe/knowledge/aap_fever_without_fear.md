# Fever Without Fear: Information for Parents

## Understanding Fever

### What is a Fever?
- Normal body temperature varies throughout the day
- Fever is generally defined as temperature above 100.4°F (38°C) rectally
- Fever is NOT a disease - it's a symptom and natural defense mechanism
- The body raises temperature to fight infection

### Why Fever Happens
- Fever activates the immune system
- Higher temperatures may slow growth of bacteria and viruses
- Fever stimulates production of white blood cells
- Most fevers are caused by viral infections that resolve on their own

## Common Misconceptions

### Myth: Higher fever means worse illness
- **Reality**: How sick a child looks and behaves matters more than the number
- A child with 103°F playing happily may be less concerning than one with 101°F who is very lethargic

### Myth: Fever must be treated immediately
- **Reality**: Treatment is for comfort, not necessarily to normalize temperature
- Many fevers do not need medication

### Myth: Fever always damages the brain
- **Reality**: Fever from infection rarely goes above 106°F (41.1°C)
- Body has natural temperature regulation
- Brain damage from fever is extremely rare and occurs only at extreme temperatures (>107°F)

### Myth: Febrile seizures cause permanent damage
- **Reality**: Febrile seizures, while scary, typically do not cause lasting harm
- They occur in 2-4% of children and are related to rapid temperature rise
- Most children who have one do not have another

## Managing Fever at Home

### Focus on Comfort
- Keep child lightly dressed
- Maintain comfortable room temperature
- Encourage rest
- Offer clear fluids frequently

### Hydration is Key
- For infants: breast milk or formula
- For older children: water, diluted juice, oral rehydration solutions
- Signs of good hydration: regular urination, tears when crying

### When to Consider Fever Reducers
- Child is uncomfortable or in distress
- Child cannot sleep due to discomfort
- Child has history of febrile seizures (discuss with doctor)
- Always follow dosing instructions carefully
- NEVER give aspirin to children (risk of Reye's syndrome)

## Stay Calm

- Most fevers resolve within 2-3 days
- Trust your parental instincts
- Focus on how your child looks and acts
- When unsure, contact your pediatrician
