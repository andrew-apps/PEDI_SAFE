# Fever and Your Baby

## Temperature Thresholds by Age

### Infants 0-3 months
- **EMERGENCY**: Any rectal temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher requires IMMEDIATE medical attention
- Do NOT give fever-reducing medication without doctor's advice
- Call your pediatrician or go to emergency room right away

### Infants 3-6 months
- Temperature of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher: Call pediatrician
- Temperature above 102°F (38.9°C): Seek medical evaluation
- Watch for signs of illness beyond fever

### Infants 6-12 months
- Temperature of 102°F (39°C) or higher: Contact pediatrician
- Temperature above 103°F (39.4°C): Medical evaluation recommended
- Monitor behavior and other symptoms

### Children over 12 months
- Temperature of 102.2°F (39°C) or higher lasting more than 24 hours: Call doctor
- Any fever lasting more than 3 days: Medical evaluation needed

## How to Take Temperature

### Rectal (most accurate for infants)
- Use digital thermometer with petroleum jelly
- Insert 1/2 to 1 inch
- Wait for beep
- Normal: 97.9-100.4°F (36.6-38°C)

### Axillary (armpit)
- Less accurate, add 1°F to reading
- Hold thermometer in armpit for 4-5 minutes
- Normal: 96.6-98°F (35.9-36.7°C)

### Temporal (forehead)
- Quick and non-invasive
- May be less accurate in young infants
- Follow manufacturer instructions

## What is Fever?

- Fever is the body's natural response to infection
- It helps fight illness by activating the immune system
- The height of fever does not always indicate severity of illness
- How your child looks and acts is more important than the number

## General Comfort Measures

- Keep child comfortable and hydrated
- Dress in light clothing
- Offer plenty of fluids (breast milk, formula, water for older children)
- Keep room at comfortable temperature
- Do NOT use alcohol baths or ice water
- Contact pediatrician before giving any medication to infants under 3 months
