# High Temperature (Fever) in Children - NHS Guidelines

## What is a High Temperature?

- Normal body temperature is about 36-37°C (96.8-98.6°F)
- A high temperature is 38°C (100.4°F) or above
- A high temperature is very common in young children
- It's usually a sign the body is fighting an infection

## When to Get Medical Help

### Call 999 or go to A&E if your child:
- Has a stiff neck
- Has a rash that does not fade when you press a glass against it
- Is bothered by light
- Has a fit (seizure) for the first time
- Has unusually cold hands or feet
- Has pale, blotchy, blue or grey skin
- Has a weak, high-pitched cry that's not like their normal cry
- Is drowsy and hard to wake
- Is finding it hard to breathe and sucks their stomach in under their ribs
- Is not responding like they normally do
- Is under 3 months old with a temperature of 38°C or above

### See a GP or call 111 if your child:
- Is under 3 months old with a temperature of 38°C or above
- Is 3 to 6 months old with a temperature of 39°C or above
- Has a high temperature for more than 5 days
- Does not want to eat or is not their usual self
- Has a high temperature that does not come down with paracetamol

## Age-Specific Temperature Guidelines

### Under 3 months
- Temperature 38°C (100.4°F) or above: Seek medical help urgently
- This is always serious in newborns

### 3-6 months
- Temperature 39°C (102.2°F) or above: Contact GP
- Lower temperatures: Monitor carefully

### Over 6 months
- Focus on how child looks and behaves
- High temperature alone is not always serious
- Watch for other concerning symptoms

## How to Care for a Feverish Child at Home

### Do:
- Give them plenty to drink
- Look out for signs of dehydration
- Give paracetamol if they're distressed (follow instructions)
- Keep them at home and check on them during the night
- Keep them comfortable - remove excess layers if needed

### Don't:
- Undress your child or sponge them down to cool them (this won't help)
- Cover them up in lots of clothes or bedding
- Give aspirin to children under 16
- Give ibuprofen to babies under 3 months or under 5kg
- Give paracetamol to babies under 2 months
- Combine ibuprofen and paracetamol unless a GP says to

## Signs of Dehydration in Children

- Drowsiness
- Sunken eyes
- Cold hands and feet
- Fewer wet nappies
- Dry nappies or less urine
- Dark yellow wee

## Duration of Fever

- Most fevers caused by infections last 3-4 days
- Fever lasting more than 5 days should be checked by a doctor
- Some viral illnesses can cause fever that comes and goes for up to 2 weeks

## Common Causes of Fever

- Viral infections (colds, flu, COVID-19)
- Bacterial infections (ear infections, chest infections, UTIs)
- After vaccinations (usually mild and short-lived)
- Teething (may cause very mild temperature rise, not true fever)
